        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        For the Lost and Found assignment, we were assigned a partner and
        received from them a written description of an object they've lost in
        the past that has significance to them. Based on the description Eric
        gave me, my guess is that he lost a Nintendo DS, and I wanted to take
        his color and locational queues and create a composition around the
        object he described.
      </p>
      <p>
        The description I provided Eric is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Carrot the Caterpillar</i>
      </p>
       <p>The object I lost was actually a creature. My brother and I had
        found a caterpillar and our family decided to catch it, feed it, and
        watch it turn into a butterfly. We set him up in a tank with some
        leaves, carrot stalks/greens (hence its name), and twigs, and eventually
        Carrot crawled up onto a twig and formed a chrysalis. We watched it
        change over time, but eventually the season for a butterfly to emerge
        had past, and Carrot did not come out. It turned out that we didn’t add
        enough moisture to the tank, and that Carrot dried out before he could
        metamorphosize, and thus he was lost :( Always remember to water your
        caterpillars…
      </p>
      <p> The tank was fairly small and rectangular, and there was a slight
        taper, so the bottom was a bit smaller than the top. The walls were
        clear plastic and the cap on top was a bright green with repetitive
        vertical indents on the sides. The top of the cap had a small clear
        plastic door we could open to add things or take stuff out (but you
        can’t see it from a side view). There were a couple small twigs inside,
        and the diagonal one that went from the bottom corner to the opposing
        top corner is the one that Carrot picked for his chrysalis. It’s 2/3 of
        the way up the twig, and by the end of his time with us it was a soft
        brown, somewhat triangular (but rounded edges) on the top, and the
        bottom half was longer and comes to a point asymmetrically/off-center.
        The chrysalis is only around an inch or two long, and its suspended by a
        small stem of sorts above the carrot leaves. Some of the small,
        feathery, old green leaves have bites taken out of them from a long time
        ago. In the end, the cap was the brightest green, and most everything
        else had a hint of brown and dryness.

      <p>
        Before beginning this project, I read through Eric's description a
        couple of times in order to pull out any specific details, as well as to
        investigate whether or not I knew what the actual object was (he never
        named it). I realized that he was probably explaining a Nintendo DS, so
        I ran with that for my p5 sketch. 
      </p>

      <p>I made a couple of thumbnail sketches
        and decided I wanted try creating a DS loosely depicted in perspective
        with some game cards behind it, and this way I could use a variety of
        coding tools to create it. I used a lot of trial and error to get all my
        lines to look approximately how I wanted them, and ultimately, I was
        able to include most of the components I’d intended to. Last minute, I
        decided to make the screens change color depending on where the mouse is
        on the screen to make the sketch more fun and interactive.

        Eric provided me with this description of his lost object:

        <br />“It’s a flipping box, with two screens on both sides. The top one
        is untouchable, the lower one is touchable. Few buttons located on the
        lower level, there should be 4 on the left and 6 on the right. Two
        buttons are located at the corner of the lower level’s back. There’s a
        place you can put cards in on the back. It’s mainly black but the
        buttons are all in white.”
        <br />
        <br />I noticed that he used a lot of language that referred to the
        object in reference to its three-dimensional form (describing things
        from the front and back for example) as opposed to picturing it from a
        single reference point as I did for mine. I found it interesting to
        mentally translate his description to something that can be viewed in a
        mostly-stagnant sketch from a singular angle. I think my prior knowledge
        of the item I believe he was describing allowed me to create a fairly
        informed depiction based on what he wrote. It’s really interesting to
        see how his description differed from mine in structure and content.
        <br />
        <br />I think my final image would have looked a lot different if I had
        designed it in Illustrator as opposed to in p5, for example. The nature
        of using the coordinate system to code an image slows down the design
        process for me, and I think while this is an appropriate rendition of
        the description I received, I think I could still take the background
        further, for example. I’m really happy with the lighting effect though,
        and I think interaction is a better way to use code than solely creating
        a static image. I enjoyed jumping back into code for this project and
        seeing how different people describe and interpret things differently.

        This project was a collaboration with Eric Shu. It was created in the
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/">Online p5.js Editor</a> with the help
        of some Code Train Videos, particularly
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9sgjuh-CBM">this one</a>.
