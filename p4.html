        ID: A blue background with a cool gray character in the middle, the head is an iPhone, the torso is a grey dress shirt with a striped tie, and the character has a dark skirt, and is hooked up to a domino power brick. Each of the three eyes follows the mouse.

      <p>
      For this project, we created a character, kept the head, then exchanged the body parts with those of other characters created by other members in our group to create an “exquisite corpse.” We then transferred those beings to a p5js sketch.

        Design Process
      </h1>
        <p> 
          First, I designed my character: Mr. Apple. I thought back to some of the other assignments to think of what people were inspired by/interested in and a number of people have made iPhone related projects. I was toying with the idea of a character that would be relevant to college students, and I realized there’s just a lot of Apple to go around. I wanted to take a bit of a spin on standard Apple products. Here is my initial sketch and my description: 
        </p>

        <p> 
          I feel as though I tend to find myself surrounded by screens. My laptop sits directly in front of me while my phone rests beside it and my iPad plays music through my Bluetooth speaker. There are so many screens that I feel like sometimes people turn into them. Mr. Apple is a prime example, a screeny. He has three eyes from staring too intently at his technology (he had to add a third because two simply weren’t enough). His hair style is always in flux because it’s so versatile, all he has to do is think up a new one on the internet and wear it for a day. His shirts work the same way, as any image can become the newest fashion statement. Unless it involves buttons. Buttons are outdated. Side note, if the Wifi connection is really bad, he won’t be able to hear you very well. He gets that from all the Zoom calls. Lastly, we can’t forget his shoes. We all know how modern technology likes to walk all over USB-A's. Mr. Apple is a trend setter.

          I received components from 3 different groupmates. The body of my corpse is from Aisha’s “Richard” drawing, the abdomen is from Sophie’s Nun character, and the power bank is from Amanda’s “Dominox” robot.

          Richard is a baby with huge claws on his hands to protect himself from the monsters under his bed. He wears an office attire everyday to pretend to look older so that the monsters do not hurt him like they do regular children. His feet are big and long so that they can hold the rest of his body upright.

          The nun was dressed in a black robe and a white turban, which seemed calm and elegant. A gray cross pendant lay quietly on the white piece of her chest. In Catholicism, the cross on the chest is a clothing accessory for the clergy of the monastery. This shows that her identity is unusual. However, her face was pale and her lips were blood red, giving a great visual impact. This will make people confused whether it is red lips or bloody mouth. Her eyes drooped and looked innocent, like a cute child. But the combination of the whole expression looks a little weird. Her calm face and big horrified eyes give people a sense of suppressed and unknown fear. She seemed to be staring at the person looking at her with pleading and fearful eyes. The combination of these elements makes her strange and complicated. This has to make people worry that her behavior and appearance will be very different.

          The Dominox is a machine with a human concept. The numbers on the dominoes represent the number of features on what a human face would have, organs placed as a human would have, and the neck as an empty domino piece to represent that the machine has no voice therefore it can only express in actions. The philosophy behind Dominox is simple as it sounds; dominoes are built to collapse only to be built & collapse again in different forms. But because it is a machine with a human concept, the Dominox is paired with a domino power bank to give it a machine driven power to bring itself to life every time it collapses.

        The New Thing: It's backstory
      </p>
      <p>
        It is really somethin’ else. It was born an iPhone, slowly developing different updates and features (like another eye). Because It is a modern... thing... there were a lot of options available to customize the user experience (life). It got tired of opposable thumbs and opted for paws and claws, for example. Also, in order to maintain its religious background in which it was apparently cultivated, it wears a nun skirt to complement its favorite color scheme. This image shows standard work apparel for It while it’s in the process of caffeinating via a domino power bank. It is ready for the day!

      I think this was a cool way to collaborate visually to create something with an unexpected result. I learned how to upload image or .png files into my p5 sketch, and I think this will help me significantly in being more efficient when I’m coding. This time, it allowed me to create a base illustration to work off of, and from there I could add my interactive elements. I still would like to add more interactivity to the sketch, specifically with regard to the lights on the domino power bank. It would be cool to have the power left in it correspond with the time of day. 
      </p> 
      <p> 
      In general, I think this was an effective sketch. I feel confident with translate(), push(), pop(), and creating my own functions. I want to figure out if there’s a way to download code from an ai file that translates directly into p5 (you can download the svg code but it’s uncompatible with p5). This would give me more flexibility and confidence in the designs I start with and the ability to make sketches that are more organically interactive. I like the character that came out of this project, and I’m surprised how cohesive the components look together despite coming from very obscure characters.

        I had some help from Maya Rodic to figure out how to import images/png’s and in using that syntax :)
